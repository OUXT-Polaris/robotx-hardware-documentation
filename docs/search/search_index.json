OUXT Polaris \u2693\ufe0e We have been participating in the RobotX Challenge since 2014, and we are currently the only team in Japan. The official team website is here . RobotX Challenge \u2693\ufe0e The RobotX Challenge is an international, university-level competition that aims to develop autonomous navigation technology for small boats. Each team is required to develop and install a propulsion system, sensors, computers, communication devices, and other systems necessary for autonomous navigation on a catamaran called WAM-V , which is provided by the competition organizers. Rendering image of an example RobotX course layout. WAM-V \u2693\ufe0e Wave Adaptive Suspension [ Marine Advanced Robotics, Inc. https://www.wam-v.com/about ] As a rule of the competition, the basic structure of the USV must be the WAM-V 16 ASV manufactured by Marine Advanced Robotics. The WAM-V is a catamaran that has a feature called Wave Adaptive Suspension, which enables the left and right hulls to oscillate independently in response to the water surface. The WAM-V provided by the competition organizer does not include any outfitting other than the hull, such as propulsion units, batteries, and sensors. The specifications are shown in the table below.
