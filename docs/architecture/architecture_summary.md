# Architecture

In this part, we describe the hardware architecture of the entire robot assembled for competition or experimentation. The architecture is represented by a block diagram using [Mermaid's Syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/){:target="_blank"}.

## Competition robots

This is the list of robots developed for the RobotX Challenge competition, and the status of their documentation. Since the competition started with only USVs, but now there are tasks that require UUVs and UAVs, there is a column in the table that indicates the type of robot that has been required for each competition.

| Competition | USV | UUV | UAV | Writing Progress |

## Robots for experimental use

This is a list of robots developed not for RobotX competitions, but for experimental purposes, and the status of their documentation.

| Name | Type | Writing Progress |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| Mini-V | USV |  |

### Mini-V

</figure>

This is a catamaran-type USV, much smaller than the WAM-V, designed to improve the efficiency of software development, and can be used for experiments in rivers and lakes without being restricted by the relevant laws in Japan.

ソフトウェア開発の効率を向上させるために作成したWAM-Vよりも非常に小型の双胴船タイプのUSV．日本国内の関連法規に制限されることなく，河川や湖で実験を行うことができます．
