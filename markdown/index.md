This documentation site represents the architecture and detailed design of the hardware that OUXT is developing for RobotX. It includes not only information that has already been developed, but also is in the conceptual stage.

## OUXT

We have been participating in the RobotX Challenge since 2014, and we are currently the only team in Japan.

The official team website is [here](https://www.ouxt.jp/en/).

## RobotX Challenge

[The RobotX Challenge](https://robotx.org/) is an international, university-level competition that aims to develop autonomous navigation technology for small boats. Each team is required to develop and install a propulsion system, sensors, computers, communication devices, and other systems necessary for autonomous navigation on a catamaran called [WAM-V](https://www.wam-v.com/), which is provided by the competition organizers.
